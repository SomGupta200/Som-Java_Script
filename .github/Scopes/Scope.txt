JavaScript has the following kinds of scopes:

Global scope: The default scope for all code running in script mode.
Module scope: The scope for code running in module mode.
Function scope: The scope created with a function.
Block scope: The scope created with a pair of curly braces (a block).

// Important
Blocks only scope let and const declarations, but not var declarations.
